# Gmail Automation Project

This project demonstrates an automation script using Python and Selenium to perform automated login to Gmail using credentials from an Excel file. The script utilizes the `webdriver_manager` library to manage the ChromeDriver setup.

## Features

- **Login Automation**: The script automates the login process to Gmail using provided credentials.
- **Excel Integration**: Credentials are read from an Excel file, and the results are written back to another Excel file.
- **Executable File**: The project includes an executable file (`GmailAutomation.exe`) for easy distribution without requiring Python installation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- openpyxl
- webdriver_manager
- Chrome browser

## Setup

1. Install dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium openpyxl webdriver_manager
   ```

2. Download and install the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python GmailAutomation.py
   ```

   OR, run the executable file:
   ```bash
   ./dist/GmailAutomation.exe
   ```

## Configuration

- **ChromeDriver Path**: If needed, update the `chrome_driver_path` variable in the script with the correct path to your ChromeDriver executable.

- **Excel File Paths**: Update the paths for the login credentials Excel file (`login_credentials.xlsx`) and the result Excel file (`result.xlsx`) in the script.

## Usage

1. Place the login credentials in the `login_credentials.xlsx` file.
2. Run the script to automate the Gmail login process.
3. Check the `result.xlsx` file for the success/failure status of each login attempt.
